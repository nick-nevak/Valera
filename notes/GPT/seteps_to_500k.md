Reducing RMSE to your target of around 500,000 from the current 1.27M is ambitious but feasible with the right enhancements to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization. Here's a structured plan to improve your model:

1. Advanced Feature Engineering
   Use Macro Features
   Integrate macroeconomic indicators and aggregate them to match the transaction timestamp. These may capture economic trends affecting real estate prices.
   Feature examples: usdrub, gdp*growth, and mortgage_rate.
   Spatial Feature Aggregations
   Proximity Features: Aggregate features based on weighted proximity to amenities (e.g., weighted by the square of distances).
   Raion-Level Averages: For features such as green_part*_, calculate the mean/median at the raion level for normalization.
   Interaction Features
   Create interaction features (e.g., full_sq _ distance_to_center or full_sq / life_sq).
   Temporal Features
   Extract month, quarter, and year from the timestamp and capture seasonality effects.
2. Data Augmentation and Cleaning
   Target Encoding
   Apply target encoding to categorical variables like sub_area and product_type. Use cross-validation to avoid leakage.
   Winsorization of Extreme Outliers
   Outliers can affect RMSE. Winsorize extreme values in the target (price_doc) to make the model less sensitive to large errors.
   Missing Value Imputation
   Experiment with advanced imputation methods (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors Imputation or Iterative Imputer) for missing features.
   Scaling and Normalization
   Normalize continuous variables (e.g., full_sq, life_sq) with log-transformation where appropriate. For example, log(1 + full_sq) can stabilize variance.
3. Model Tuning
   Parameter Optimization
   Use Bayesian Optimization or HyperOpt to fine-tune XGBoost hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_child_weight, subsample, learning_rate).
   Example: Experiment with increasing max_depth for better fitting of complex relationships.
   Ensemble Methods
   Combine multiple models (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost) using a stacking approach.
   Feature Selection
   Use SHAP or feature importance to drop uninformative features, which can reduce overfitting.
   Loss Function Customization
   For RMSE improvement, experiment with tweaking the loss function. Weighted RMSE or Huber loss might help balance the focus on small and large errors.
4. Validation and Error Analysis
   Stratified Validation
   Use stratified K-Fold validation on sub_area or temporal splits to avoid overfitting to specific regions or times.
   Error Buckets
   Analyze high-error predictions. Are errors concentrated in specific sub_areas or time periods? This may reveal new features or cleaning opportunities.
5. Experiment with Data Augmentation
   Synthetic Data Generation: Create synthetic rows by slightly modifying existing features (e.g., full_sq Â±5% or noise in macro features).
   Bootstrapping: Randomly sample rows with replacement for robustness in training.
6. External Datasets
   Integrate additional external datasets that influence property prices (e.g., demographic data, crime rates, historical price trends).
7. Leverage Model Explainability
   Use SHAP or LIME to explain predictions and iteratively refine feature importance. If macro features or proximity features rank highly, focus on enhancing them.
   Expected Improvements
   Each of these changes might improve RMSE incrementally. For example:
   Adding macroeconomic data: ~5-10% improvement.
   Advanced feature engineering: ~10-15%.
   Model tuning and ensembles: ~5-10%.
   Combined, these can potentially reduce your RMSE close to 500k, though this depends on the complexity of the underlying data and target distribution.
